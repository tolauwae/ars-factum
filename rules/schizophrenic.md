Whether caused by some psychosis, a magical mishap, punishment by a celestial being, or some other means, you are cursed to have two minds that share a single body.
However, only one mind can be conscience at a time, and neither has control over when the minds switch.
While often a curse, the two minds allow you to have a unique range of abilities, far outreaching your contemporaries.

## Feat: Two minds, One body

Your body is inhabited by two minds. When you gain this feat, choose a second class.
You gain new skills, saving throw, and language proficiencies, new spell slots, and its own alignment for this new class, which is the same level as your other class.
This class is associated with your second mind, which has its own personality and history.

The two classes share every other stats, including hit points, hit dice, background, creature type, size, speed and equipment.
Both classes level up at the same time.

However, you only have access to one class at a time, and you switch between the two classes randomly.
Whenever an event in the [*Consciousness table*](./schizophrenic#consciousness) table below occurs, you must make a Cognitive Check.
Whenever you roll equal or higher than the number in the table, you switch to the other class.
