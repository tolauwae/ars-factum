# Weapon Customisation

All weapons in D&D are the same. The only way to get better versions is to acquire magical versions with +1, +2, or +3 bonuses, or with extra magical damage, often fire.

But why not differentiate between the quality of non-magical weapons?

## New Weapon Properties

New properties can add extra requirements to non-magical weapons, to compensate for higher damage than the standard version of those weapons.

+ **Elegant.** This weapon requires exceptional skill to use. You must have a Dexterity score of 16 or higher to wield an elegant weapon.
+ **Hefty.** This weapon is unusually large for its type. You must have a Strength score of 14 or higher to wield a hefty weapon.
+ **Superheavy.** This weapon is so heavy it knocks enemies prone on a successful hit, but also requires incredible strength to wield. (18 STR or higher)
+ **Precise.** This weapon demands perfect accuracy and timing. You must have a Dexterity score of 14 or higher to wield a precise weapon. On a critical hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.
+ **Brutal.** This weapon's devastating strikes can cleave through armor. You must have a Strength score of 16 or higher to wield a brutal weapon. When you hit with this weapon, you can reroll any damage die that shows a 1, but you must use the new roll.
+ **Unwieldy.** This weapon's awkward construction makes it difficult to ready quickly. You must have a Strength score of 15 or higher to wield an unwieldy weapon. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls while wielding this weapon, but it deals an extra damage die on a hit.
+ **Balanced.** This weapon requires extensive martial training to use effectively. You must be proficient with at least three martial weapons to wield a balanced weapon. You can use either Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls with this weapon.
+ **Momentum.** This weapon becomes more dangerous as you maintain your offensive. When you hit the same target with this weapon on consecutive turns, the second hit deals an extra 1d4 damage, and the third and subsequent consecutive hits deal an extra 1d6 damage. Missing or attacking a different target resets this bonus.
+ **Tactical.** This weapon features complex mechanisms that reward cleverness over brawn. You must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher to wield a tactical weapon. You can use Intelligence instead of Strength or Dexterity for attack and damage rolls.
+ **Ceremonial.** This weapon's ornate design and symbolic power inspire allies. You must have a Charisma score of 14 or higher to wield a ceremonial weapon. Allies within 10 feet of you gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wield this weapon.

## Custom weapon damage

Using the new weapon properties you can create different custom weapons, these weapons can do increased damage due to their improved quality.

One way to increase the damage of these improved weapons is by given them larger damage dice than the standard version.
For instance, a superheavy waraxe could have 2d8 instead of 1d8, or an elegant dagger deals 1d8 instead of 1d4.
Let your creativity go wild.

Generally, the table below shows what ability score requirement merits what level of damage.

| Damage | Ability Score | 
| ------ | ------------- |
| d4     | 12            |
| d6     | 14            |
| d8     | 16            |
| d10    | 18            |
| d12    | 20            |

## Quality levels

Aside from changing the damage type, you may also categorize weapons in different levels of quality.

+ **Broken.** roll twice the normal damage dice, take the lowest.
+ **Sturdy.** roll twice the normal damage dice, take the highest.
+ **Dwarven.** roll one extra damage die.
+ **Elven.** your weapon uses damage dice that are one size larger than normal, to a maximum of d12. So 1d4 becomes 1d6, but 1d12 stays 1d12.
