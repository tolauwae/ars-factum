# Weapon Customisation

All weapons in D&D are the same. The only way to get better versions is to acquire magical versions with +1, +2, or +3 bonusses, or with extra magical damage, often fire.

But why not differentiate between the quality of non-magical weapons?

## New Weapon Properties

New properties can add extra requirements to non-magical weapons, to compensate for higher damage than the standard version of those weapons.

+ **Elegant.** This weapon requires exceptional skill to use. You must have a Dexterity score of 16 or higher to wield an elegant weapon.
+ **Hefty.** This weapon is unusually large for its type. You must have a Strength score of 14 or higher to wield a superheavy weapon.
+ **Superheavy.** This weapon is so heavy it knocks enemies prone on a succesful hit, but also requires incredible strength to wield. (18 STR or higher)

These properties allow for nonmagical weapons with larger dice than the standard version, for instance a superheavy waraxe could have 2d8 instead of 1d8, or an elegant dagger with 1d8 instead of 1d4.

Generally the table below shows what ability score requirement merits what level of damage.

| Damage | Ability Score | 
| ------ | ------------- |
| d4     | 12            |
| d6     | 14            |
| d8     | 16            |
| d10    | 18            |
| d12    | 20            |

## Quality levels

+ **Broken.** roll twice the normal damage dice, take the lowest.
+ **Sturdy.** roll twice the normal damage dice, take the highest.
+ **Dwarven.** roll one extra damage die.
+ **Elven.** your weapon uses damage dice that are one size larger than normal, to a maximum of d12. So 1d4 becomes 1d6, but 1d12 stays 1d12.
