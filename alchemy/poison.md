# Poisons

![banner](../images/banner.png)

Poisons are a common weapon in the arsenal of many adventurers. Creating the most deadly toxins requires a lot of patience and skill. But anyone who finds a recipe can attempt to make a poison.

## Types of Poison

There are four types of poisons: **ingested**, **contact**, **injury** and **inhaled**.

- Ingested poisons are the easiest to make and can be used to poison a cup of wine or a delicious meal.
- Contact poisons need to merely touch the skin of their victims to work.
- Injury poisons can be applied to weapons, or the like, that perform piercing or slashing damage.
- Inhaled poisons are the most difficult to make, but need only be inhaled by your target to do their damage.

## Rarity of Poisons

The rarity of poison is determined by the rarest component required by its recipe. When you brew a poison, you can use rare components, but this does not increase the rarity of the poison or improve its effects in anyway.

## Brewing Poisons

In order to brew a poison, an adventurer needs to know the recipe listing all the requirements. Similar to spells, some can be replaced by gold and others cannot. The requirements for a poison are split into components and ingredients.

**Ingredients** are everyday items, such as water, vinegar, etc. These can be replaced by a gold cost. It is assumed that an adventurer can acquire these items for the stated cost as part of the poison making process.

**Components** are not so easily come by and cannot be replaced by gold. This does not mean that these cannot be bought at the right places for the right price. Furthermore, the properties of these components will determine the strength and effects of the poison.

 <span id="brewing-difficulty-table" class="tbheader">Brewing Difficulty</span>

| Rarity    | Brewing  | CR  | DC  |
| --------- | -------- | --- | --- |
| common    | 8 hours  | any | 10  |
| uncommon  | 16 hours | 1+  | 15  |
| rare      | 24 hours | 6+  | 20  |
| very rare | 32 hours | 14+ | 25  |
| legendary | 40 hours | -   | 30  |

Mixing a poison takes a number of hours, sometimes even days or weeks. And the process is concluded with an ability check with a *poisoner's kit*. The required time and 
DC can be determined by the rarest component involved. The [*Brewing Difficulty*](./poison#brewing-difficulty-table) table shows the standard DC and time needed. But these can be overruled by the poison recipe.

On a successful check, you create the poison which has the rarity of its rarest required component (not the rarest used).
On a fail, the resulting brew is useless and all the involved components are destroyed.

## Making Antidotes

The same techniques you use to create poisons can also be used to brew antidotes. Using a *poisoner's kit*, an adventurer can attempt to create an antidote for a specific poison.

In order to do this, you need one dose of the poison you wish to cure and one *restorative* component of the same rarity as the poison. The time required to brew the potion usually takes one eighth of the brewing time of the poison, but the tool check DC is the same.

## Components

Components are both natural and synthetic ingredients which form the basis of any poison recipe. They can be acquired, refined and used in many different ways.

### Types and Rarity

There are four types of components: **befuddling** (purple), **corrupting** (black), and **venomous** (green), **restorative** (white).

Components also differ in potency. Alchemists codify potency in five levels of rarity: **common**, **uncommon**, **rare**, **very rare**, and **legendary**. Legendary components cannot be found in the wild, but only refined from other components.

### Generic Components

Generic components are interchangeable. When a poison recipe asks for two befuddling (purple) and one venomous (green) components, any component of those types can be used. However, thee components must be used. Any component with multiple types can only be used for one of the requirements.

### Unique Components

Some poison recipes may ask for unique components. These components have special properties which can be used to make unique and often powerful poisons. They still have a type, and can be used as generic components as well.

## Gathering Components

Many components can be found in nature. Most plants and fungi can be harvested easily by anyone with a glove and a knife. Other poisons require more skill to extract, for instance the venom from a giant spider, or the poisonous gas from a green dragon.

Gathering components typically takes two steps. As the first optional step, an adventurer can scavenge for resources which may yield useful components. After finding a resource&mdash;such as a slain monster&mdash;you can attempt to extract a component from it.

### Scavenging

A scavenging character makes a **Wisdom (Survival) check** whenever you call for it, with a DC determined by the abundance of food and water in the region. If multiple characters scavenge, each character makes a separate check. A scavenging character finds nothing on a failed check. On a successful check, it finds a resource from which it can attempt to extract a component.

::: tip Note to DMs

As a guideline, you can consult the [*Scavenging Difficulty*](./poison#scavenging-difficulty-table) table, which associates a biome's resource availability with a scavenging DC.

:::

<span id="scavenging-difficulty-table" class="tbheader">Scavenging Difficulty</span>

| Resource Availability | DC  |
| --------------------- | --- |
| Abundant              | 10  |
| Limited               | 15  |
| Very Little           | 20  |

### Extracting

Many of the resources adventurers find while foraging, are easily extracted and require no check. But some plants are dangerous, some stones need to be quarried, and extracting poison from a slain monster requires the right tools.

An adventurer can simply try to extract a component with their bare hands or the simple tools at their disposal. In that case, they simply make a **Wisdom (Nature) check**. An adventurer may also extract poisons, with a *poisoner's kit*. They make an ability check with the tool instead.

::: tip Note to DMs

To determine the DC for an extraction, the DM can use the [*Brewing Difficulty*](./poison#brewing-difficulty-table) table.
When extracting from a slain monster, you can use the CR of the monster to determine the DC.
The table does not list a CR for legendary components because these can not be found in the wild.

It is encouraged to adapt the DC to the specific situation, such as whether the adventurer uses a *poisoner's kit*, or the volatility of the resource.

:::

In either case, on a successful check, the extractor gains one component.
On a fail, the resource becomes exhausted and cannot be used for at least 48 hours.

## The Process of Refinement

Skilled poisoners can turn natural components into even more powerful version. Stones are turned into powder, herbs are distilled into extract, and from other components essences are made.
Anyone with a *poisoner's kit* can try to refine a component.
Refinement requires a long rest to perform per level of rarity of the base material.
Taking a maximum of 4 long rests for a very rare component.
These long rest need not be consecutive.

After the last long rest the refinement process, the refiner makes an ability check with their *poisoner's kit*.
The [*Brewing Difficulty*](./poison#brewing-difficulty-table) table can be used to determine the DC for refining a component.
The DC depends on the rarity level of the base components.
When successful, the resulting artificial component is exactly one level of rarity higher than their base component.
On a fail, the component is destroyed and worthless.

A refined component is synthetic, and cannot be refined further.

## Using Poisons

How you employ your poisons is determined primarily by the type of poison.

**Contact.** Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

**Ingested.** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

**Inhaled.** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to this effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterwards. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

**Injury.** Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects. Applying a poison to a weapon takes an action.

## Identifying Poisons

You can make an ability check with a poisoner's kit to identify a single dose of poison or antidote.
Researching a potion in this way takes one hour.
At the end, you learn all properties of the poison or antidote.

The [*Brewing Difficulty*](./poison#brewing-difficulty-table) table can be used to determine the DC using the rarity of the poison.

## Learning Recipes

To make a poison, you first need to learn its recipe. The easiest way is to find or buy a written down version. But an alchemist can attempt to learn the recipe of a poison by using a *poisoner's kit* on a dose of the poison. In order to learn the recipe of a poison, you must first know all properties of the potion.

This process takes one long rest, and a successful tool check. On a success, you learn the complete recipe of the poison.
On a fail, the sample is destroyed and you learn nothing.
Again, the [*Brewing Difficulty*](./poison#brewing-difficulty-table) table can be used to determine the DC using the rarity of the poison.

## Effectiveness

When a creature which is already under the effect of a poison, suffers an additional dose of same poison , its effect are not compounded.
Instead, the duration of the effect is refreshed.
The only exception is instant non-recurring damage, which is reapplied.

Other poisons still enjoy the same effectiveness, regardless of how many poisons already affects the poisoned creature.

## Availability

The availability of poisons and their components is dependent on the setting of you game. Similar to magic items, the abundance or scarcity are the most important factors in balancing the power of poisons in your game. Typically, common poisons and components can be bought in shops. While everything rarer is harder to buy.

## Artifacts

The most powerful potions a mortal can normally ever make are legendary potions using especially created legendary components.
However, there are rumors of and legends of even more powerful components.
Artifacts created by gods or other powerful forces.
These can be used to create unique and singular potions of artifact level.
More likely, your adventures find these potions in the ruins of an ancient civilization or the lair of a powerful lich.

These kinds of potions cannot be reproduced.
No antiddotes can be created for artifacts poisons and artifact components cannot be refined.

## Improving your Poisoner Skills

::: tip This is a variant rule.
The following rule is entirely optional, because it varies widely from the typical rules in 5e edition Dungeon and Dragons by granting permanent bonuses to stats with achievements.
:::

Additionally, you can become better at making poisons. You gain a permanent +1 bonus to your poison making skill checks whenever you complete one of the following achievements:

- create 3 different synthetic components of level 4 potency **or** collect 15 different recipes

- create a synthatic component of level 4 potency
- survive being poisoned by 5 different toxins **or** cure three different people with the correct antidote
- make a single potion with 3 different level 4 components
- create 10 unique poisons

## List of Components

The environment and biomes adventurers find themselves in, play a large roll in what kinds of components they can find.
In cities, poisoners look for mosses and climbers, while they search for fungi in caverns and mines.
Here, we present five broad types of biomes.

- **arid** (artic, deserts, mountains, stony hills)
- **aquatic** (sea, swamp, island, ocean, river, underwater)
- **cavernous** (caves, underdark, mines)
- **sylvan** (farms, feywild, forests, grasslands, hills, jungle, woodlands)
- **urban** (cities, dungeons, fortresses)

For each of these biomes we give a list of twenty generic components, as well as a handful of unique components.

::: tip Note to DMs

You can mix and match different types for a specific biome.
For instance, in an artic environment you may pick from the arid and aquatic lists.
The Shadowfell on the other hand, might be a combination of cavernous and arid.

:::

### Arid Biomes

Arid biomes are barren places with very few vegetation. The few animals that survive here often mimic the harshness of their habitat.

**Bloodhoney cactus sap.** Befuddling, rare component. The sap from this cactus is as red as blood and can cause powerful hallucinations.

**Breath of a green dragon.** Venomous, very rare component. Green dragons are poison become flash. Their breath is one of the most venomous substances found in nature.

**Couatl toxin.** Befuddling and Venomous, rare component. The toxin from a Couatl's bite can even put a full grown giant to sleep.
It is often used in sleeping draughts and poisons with similar effects.

**Jackalwere claws.** Venomous and corrupting, rare component. Poisoners have recently discovered that the claws from Jackalwers can be used to create deadly concoctions.

**Lamia Hair.** Befuddling and restorative, very
rare component. The hair from these sinister
shapeshifting desert dwellers can contain traces of
their magic long after they’ve been cut.

**Peddlebloom Roots.** Corrupting, uncommon
component. The pebblebloom flower grows in
loose gravel surfaces at the top of mountains.
When ground down the powder can create very
corrosive poisons.

**Sandbat Venom.** Venomous and corrupting,
common component. The venom of this large
desert rodent is a favorite ingredient of the many
desert tribes for their injury poisons.

**Troll Blood.** Venomous and restorative, very rare
component. Because of the regenerative
properties of troll blood, it is extremely valuable.
This green viscous liquid can be used in the
manufacturing of many poisons and certain
potions of healing.

*40% corrupting, 30% venomous, 20% befuddling, 10% restorative*

### Aquatic Biomes

Rivers, swamps, oceans, and other aquatic biomes
are abundant with natural resources. Many are
used in poison making.

**Dark Spice.** Befuddling, very rare component.
Dark spice is only found mixed with the sands at
the bottom of very deep seas. It is believed they
are used by sea elves to expand their minds and
have clearer visions of their past lives. Whether
true or not, what is known is that the sand-like
substance can be used to create powerful
befuddling poisons.

**Dragon Eel Slime.** Corrupting and venomous,
rare component. The slime of the dragon eel is so
corrosive it can dissolve armor. Dragon eels can
grow up to an impressive 10 feet in length and are
found in warm waters.

**Entangle Weed.** Corrupting and venomous, very
rare component. When immersed in saltwater
these long thin seaweeds are nigh-invisible. They
entangle any creature which swims into their
grasp and slowly dissolve them into nutrients.

**Giant Stormcoy Barbel.** Corrupting and
restorative, rare component. The barbels of the
giant stormcoy can measure a dozen feet and a
small part can form a powerful component.

**Glowing Inksquid Gills.** Restorative and
venomous, uncommon component. Glowing
inksquids are deepsea dwelling squids that can
grow over 30 feet in length. Their gills are quite
sought-after alchemical components, which can harm or heal depending on their treatment.

**Lakeleaf.** Restorative, common component.
Parsley like herb which grows on the shores of
rivers. When rubbed into meat, it never spoils. It
can also be used to create some common
antidotes.

**Ryefish eyes.** Restorative and venomous,
common component. The bright colorful eyes of
the ryefish are used in many alchemical recipes,
however, they can be hard to acquire since the
eyes can only hold their shape immersed in water.

**Seadance Algae.** Befuddling and restorative,
rare component. The rare seadance algae grows
very intricate forms which seem to dance in the
currents of the sea. It is said that triton can hear
the algae sing while they dance from miles
downstream.

**Sea Serpent Fangs.** Befuddling, corrupting and
venomous, very rare component. The fangs from
these sea swimming dragons can be used to
create almost any poison, but few are brave
enough to get one.

**Webweeds.** Befuddling and venomous,
uncommon component. These weeds grow in thin
gossamer-like strings covering smooth rocks in
rivers or lakes.

**Wreath Algae.** Undetermined, rare component.
These algae grow in circular patterns underwater
in places where someone has died. When
combined with another component of any rarity, it
gains the same types. It can only gain properties
in this way once.

### Cavernous Biomes

The caves and dungeons of a world are often
littered with treasures, but adventurers who look
past the baubles and trinkets will find many
extraordinary resources. The otherworldly
Underdark especially is home to some remarkable
toxic substances.
The following is a list of unique components
found in these biomes.

**Arachnite Poison.** Corrupting and venomous,
common component. The bloodred poison of the
tiny arachnite spider, which is only found in the
caverns of the Underdark.

**Basilisk Venom.** Corrupting and venomous,
uncommon component. The venom from the
fangs of the basilisk is legendary for its deadlines.
It is also a favorite among poisoners. It is also a
unique ingredient for the dangerous [Basilisk’s Eye](./poison#basilisk-eye)
poison.

**Basirond Spores.** Befuddling, uncommon
component. Basironds are walking insectile fungi.
They have inverted cup-like caps with a sooty
black interiors. These caps hold spores which can
cause strong hallucinatory effects when released
into the air.

**Carrion Crawler Brain Juice.** Befuddling and venomous, common component. The fluids from
this giant centipede’s brain are a dangerous
paralytic poison that can be extracted or simply
beaten out of the organ. The simplicity of
acquiring this poison made it the poison of choice
for many orcs.

**Drider Poison.** Befuddling and corrupting,
uncommon component. The poison extracted
from a Drider’s stinger is a volatile substance and
extremely dangerous to organic life.

**Giant Spider Venom.** Befuddling and
corrupting, common component. The paralyzing
venom from the giant spiders of the Underdark
are a common ingredient for drow poisons.

**Mummified Organ.** Corrupting and venomous,
uncommon component. The main ingredient in
the powerful [Dust of Mummy](./poison#mummy-dust) poison.

**Soporificanus Dust.** Befuddling, rare
component. This beautiful flower only grows in
dark damp places, especially around lakes in the
Underdark. At the lightest touch it releases a
powder in the air that puts anyone who breaths it
to sleep. It is also an important ingredient of
[*Abi-Dalzim’s Potion of Dreamless Slumber*](./poison#dreamless-slumber).
