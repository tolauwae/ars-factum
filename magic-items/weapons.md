## Bow of Biting
_Weapon (any bow or crossbow), rare (requires attunement)_

When you hit with an attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 poison damage.

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you fire.

## Serpentwrought Weapon
_Weapon (any weapon), very rare (requires attunement)_

This weapon is magical and any poison applied to it cannot lose its potency. It also cannot be washed of except by magical means. Ammunition weapons infuse their ammunition with the poison.

When you apply a second poison to the weapon, the previous is removed.

*Curse.* When you lose attunement to this weapon and after every long rest while you are attuned, you suffer one dose of the poison currently applied to the weapon.

## Thayan Spear
_Wondrous Item, Rare_

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

Any creature that is wounded by this weapon gains vulnerability to piercing damage, except if it already has immunity to this damage type.
