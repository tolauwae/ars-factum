# Miscellaneous Magic Items

## Coin of Home
_Wondrous Item, Uncommon, Attunement_

Once per day, as an action you can flip this coin and you instantly teleport home.

While attuned to the coin, you can mark any place you have slept in for at least seven days the last 30 days as your home. This removes the previous mark. The mark stays as long as you remain attuned to the coin.

## Lens of Truesight
_Wondrous Item, Legendary_

This glass lens has a diameter of 1 foot, but is extremely heavy, weighing approximately 500 pounds. (requiring a strength of 17 to lift)
 
Anything seen through the lens is as if it was seen with Truesight.

> A creature with Truesight can (1) see in normal and magical Darkness, see Invisible Creatures and Objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on Saving Throws against them, and perceive the original form of a Shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. (2) Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

However, only one side gives you benefit (1), while the other side can exclusively let you see into the Ethereal Plane.

The magic the lens holds, is so strong that it makes the glass foggy over time. After 30 days, the lens is no longer see-through. To restore it, a single vial of *Oil of Etherealness* has to be applied to the surface of the lens.

## Orb of Remembering
_Wondrous item (orb), uncommon (requires attunement)_

This orbs works as a mental library. You can mentally write down anything in it. Reading and writing information takes as much time as with pen and paper.

When you lose attunement to the orb, it loses everything that is written down in it.

## Traveler's Flask
_Wondrous item, common_

This double-sided iron flask adjusts the temperature of liquids poured from it. Any liquid poured from the blue-capped side becomes refreshingly cool. Any liquid poured from the red-capped side becomes soothingly warm.
