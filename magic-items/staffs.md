# Magic Staffs and Wands

## Hither-Thither Staff
_Wondrous Item (staff), Legendary_

This ornate walking stick has a blue gem affixed to the top. While attuned to it you can create two oval portals which are each about 6 feet by 4 feet wide. The portals  have to be placed within 500 yards on a flat surface large enough to accommodate them . Once both portals are placed, they open and the two spaces are linked. people or objects can move freely between the open portals. If they are ever more than 1 mile apart they close. Closed portals glow faintly blue.

Whenever you try to open a third portal the last created portal disappears. You can also dismiss any portal that is within 500 yards.

## Wand of Domination
_Wondrous Item, Rare, Attunement (by a wizard)_

While attuned to this wand your spell save DC increases by 2.
