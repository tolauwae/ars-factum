# Magic Equipment

## Bracelet of the Locksnake
_Wondrous Item, Uncommon, Attunement_

A bronzen snake wraps around your wrist. As an action you can mentally command the snake to lock a closed door, window, gate, chest of other object with a handle or similar opening mechanism within 10 ft. Alternatively, you can also tell the snake to handcuff a creature, whose size is not larger than medium. It will slither to its target on its own, and wrap around it in order to lock it. The target can resist this with a succesful Dexterity saving throw (DC determined by the items rarity). Otherwise, it becomes restrained.

No one can open an object locked by the snake, except if they can pull the snake from it with a strength check (DC determined by the items rarity). Any creature restrained by the snake can also use it action to attempt an escape with the same check. If the snake is forcefully removed in this way, and is still attuned to you, it will slowely find its way back to your wrist. Otherwise, it will melt into a useless puddle of metal.

While you can see the snake, as an action you can tell it to return to your wrist. The snake will keep the object locked until you dismiss it in this fashion.

## Climbing Claws

While wearing these special gloves, you can climb any vertical surface, and your climbing speed is the same as your normal movement speed.

## Goggles of Spellsight

_Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Attunement_

While you wear these goggles made of shimmering magical glass, your vision is augmented as if you are under the effect of the detect magic spell.

**Detect magic.** You sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you ense magic in this way you can use your action to see a faint aura around any invisible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

## Librarian's Gloves
_Wondorus item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

> "Can I help you find anything?" the Librarian asked. She listens as you tell her what you are looking for. "Yes, I remember seeing that tome many years ago... where was it again... oh yes, of course." Looking up to a shelf far above, she gestures her hand and a leatherbound volume is pulled from among the thousands of books and floats down into her open hand.

Whilst wearing this glove, you can cast the spell *Mage Hand* at will using only somatic components.

You can also use an action to cast the *Silence* or *Locate Object* spells. Once you cast either of these spells, you cannot cast them again until the next dawn.

## Necklace of Dark Blessing

## Sun Goggles
_Wondrous Item, uncommon_
