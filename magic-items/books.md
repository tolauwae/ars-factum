## Tome of Living Poisons
_Wondrous item (book), uncommon (2), rare (3), very rare (4)_

This book contains notes on a number of poisons, determined by the rarity of the book. The table below list all possible poisons. The GM decides which poisons or determines it randomly.

If you spend one minute to read the notes of a single poison, it appears in a neat vial on top of the book. The notes for this poison lose their magic after this.
