# Inventing

## The Designing Phase

When a character turns an idea into plans—be they architectural blueprints, a new spell, an artificed item, or a poison—they attempt to produce a number of **eureka's**: insights that count toward completing the _Design Phase_.

**Gaining a Eureka.** While taking a short or long rest, a character may spend one uninterrupted hour in deep study and planning to attempt a _Eureka Roll_. A short rest permits one roll; during a long rest a character may make at most two _Eureka Rolls_ (two hours total).
Each roll requires the hour be free of interruption and solely devoted to the design task.

**Eureka Roll.** Make a *Eureka Roll* (d20) for each hour of concentration. There are no critical failures. A failed roll simply yields no progress; a successful roll yields a *Eureka* moment as follows:

| Result | Eurekas gained |
|--------|----------------|
| 1-9    | none           |
| 10-19  | one            |
| 20     | two            |

::: tip Note to DMs
The DM may grant advantage or impose disadvantage on the roll for circumstances that significantly aid or hinder study (access to libraries, mentors, labs, interruptions, illness, magical aid, etc.).
:::

**Design Requirements.** Each design requires a number of successful _Eureka Rolls_ to complete; the DM determines the requirement for any particular spell, item, or concoction.
When the required _Eurekas_ are accumulated, the design phase is complete and the project advances to the construction or synthesis phase as the DM decides.

| Complexity | Typical Examples                                     | Suggested EUREKAs |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Trivial    | Cantrips, common consumables                         | 3 (1+1d4)         |
| Low        | 1st–2nd level spells, common alchemical recipes      | 7 (2+2d4)         |
| Moderate   | 3rd–5th level spells, uncommon → rare items          | 11 (4+3d4)        |
| High       | 6th–8th level spells, rare items, complex constructs | 16 (9+3d4)        |
| Legendary  | 9th-level spells, legendary items                    | 30 (16+4d6)       |

For example, a dungeon master may sets a new 3rd‑level spell at 8 *Eurekas*. A lone wizard on a long rest may make two *Eureka rolls* that rest, gaining 0–4 *Eurekas* depending on the results.

::: tip Note to DMs
Use _Eurekas_ to pace research and reward invested downtime. Grant research bonuses (reduced requirements, advantage, or extra progress) when PCs secure exceptional resources or mentors; likewise, make prolonged study a source of complication or rivalry when appropriate.

::: tip Alternate rule: Collaboration
The DM may rule that _Eurekas_ may be pooled among collaborators.

## Construction phase: Spells

## Construction phase: Magic Items

## Construction phase: Poisons

Basically the brewing phase described in the [Poison Manual](./poison).

## Construction phase: Weapons

Integrate: [Weapon Customisation](../rules/weapons) for an easy non-magical level of invention require at most 2 _Eurekas_.
