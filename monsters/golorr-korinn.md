**Embattled Mind.** Golorr and Korinn are two minds battling over a single body. At the start of each turn Korinn can attempt to stop Golorr. On a successful DC 19 Intelligence Saving Throw, Golorr-possessed Korinn becomes stunned until her next turn.

**Flash of Genius.** When Golorr-possessed Korinn or another creature she can see within 30 feet makes an ability check or a saving throw, she can use her reaction to add her Intelligence modifier to the roll.

**Innate Spellcasting**. Golorr-possessed Korinn's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
<br>At will: fire bolt (3 beams, +3 bonus to each damage roll), mending, enlarge/reduce (self only)
<br>3/day: erupting earth (at level 5), wall of stone, greater restoration
<br>1/day: power word stun, sunburst

**Released from Stone.** When Golorr-possessed Korinn is reduced to 0 hitpoints, the Stone of Golorr is destroyed and Korinn returns to normal at 1 hitpoint. The true aboleth form of Golorr is restored as well, at max hitpoints.

**Multiattack.** Golorr-possessed Korinn makes two infused pistol attacks.

**Fire bolt.** _Ranged Spell Attack_: +8 to hit, range 120ft, 3 beams. _Hit_: 17 (2d10 + 6) fire damage per beam. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

**Infused Pistol.** Golorr-possessed Korinn has used powerful magic and artificery to infuse her pistol with mind-altering seeker bullets. She targets one creature she can see within 30 ft. The target is hit by magic missiles, and must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 12 (2d6 + 5) psychic damage as ammunition tears at their sanity.

**Legendary Actions**

Golorr-possessed Korinn can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. Golorr-possessed Korinn regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.

**Detect**. Golorr-possessed Korinn makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Hurl Weapon.** Golorr-possessed Korinn must have constructed a magical weapon to use this action. She hurls the weapon at a target she can see within 120 ft. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target takes 28 (6d6 + 7) magical piercing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. Afterwards, the weapons turns back into a useless heap of junk.

**Cantrip (Costs 2 Actions).** Golorr-possessed Korinn casts one cantrip.

**Creation (Costs 3 Actions).** Golorr-possessed Korinn uses telekinesis to construct a magical weapon that flies around her out of nearby materials. At the start of their turn, every creature within a range of 30 ft. must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (3d6 + 2) magical slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
